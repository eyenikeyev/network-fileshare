<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>Create Sample Fileshares with Permissions</h3>

</p>
Connect to Remote Desktop with the Domain Controller and log in as mydomain.com\jane_admin. Do the same with the Client vm and log in as a random user that was generated through the Powershell script in the Active Directory lab.
</p>
On Domain Controller vm, create 4 folders in the C:\ Drive and set the Permissions in these folders (by opening the folder's Properties and click on Share under the Sharing tab)
<p>

read-access: add the group Domain Users and set Permissions to Read
<p>
write-access: add the group Domain Users and set Permissions to Read/Write
<p>
no-access: add the group Domain Admins and set Permissions to Read\Write
<p>
accounting: skip for now

<h3>Attempt to Access Fileshares</h3>

<p>
On the Client vm go to the shared folder through file explorer and type \\dc-1
<p>
Attempt to access the folders, the only one that is inaccessible by the permissions set is no-access
